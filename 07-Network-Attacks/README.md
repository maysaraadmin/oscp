# Network Attacks

Welcome to the Network Attacks section of the OSCP study guide. This section covers various network-based attacks and techniques used to exploit network protocols and services during penetration testing.

- **Sniffing**: Wireshark, tcpdump, TShark, NetworkMiner
- **Tunneling**: Chisel, Ligolo-ng, ngrok, Plink
- **Evasion**: Nmap (fragmentation, decoys), Proxychains, Metasploit encoders

## üìö Resources

- [Wireshark Documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/)
- [MITM Framework](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/MITMf)
- [Chisel Documentation](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)

## üìù Best Practices

- Always get proper authorization before conducting network attacks
- Document all network segments and devices
- Be aware of network monitoring systems
- Understand the impact of network disruptions
- Have a rollback plan for any changes made

## üìÖ Study Plan

1. Learn basic network protocols and their vulnerabilities
2. Practice with Wireshark and tcpdump for traffic analysis
3. Set up a lab environment for MITM attacks
4. Learn about tunneling techniques
5. Practice firewall and IDS evasion methods

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Only perform network attacks on networks you own or have explicit permission to test
- Be aware of laws regarding network monitoring and interception
- Document all actions and obtain necessary permissions
- Avoid disrupting production network services

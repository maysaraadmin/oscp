## üìù Best Practices

- Always get proper authorization before password cracking
- Be aware of account lockout policies
- Use appropriate wordlists for the target environment
- Document all cracking attempts and results
- Clean up any extracted credentials after testing

## üìÖ Study Plan

1. Learn about different hash types and their formats
2. Practice with basic dictionary attacks
3. Move to more advanced techniques (rules, masks, hybrid)
4. Learn about password policy bypass techniques
5. Practice in a lab environment with various hash types

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Only crack passwords you own or have explicit permission to test
- Be aware of data protection laws regarding credential storage
- Never use cracked credentials outside the scope of engagement
- Securely delete any extracted credentials after testing

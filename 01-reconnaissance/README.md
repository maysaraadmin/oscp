## Key Concepts

- **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gathering information without directly interacting with the target
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Directly interacting with the target to gather information
- **DNS Enumeration**: Discovering information about a domain's infrastructure
- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Finding subdomains of a target domain

## Tools

- `nslookup`
- `dig`
- `theHarvester`
- `Sublist3r`

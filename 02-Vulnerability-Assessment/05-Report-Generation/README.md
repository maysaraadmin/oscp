## Executive Summary

### Key Components
- **Purpose**: Brief description of the assessment
- **Scope**: Systems/applications tested
- **Timeline**: Assessment duration and dates
- **Critical Findings**: 2-3 most severe issues
- **Overall Risk Posture**: Summary of risk levels

### Example
```
During the assessment of Example Corp's external infrastructure, our team identified 12 vulnerabilities, including 2 critical issues that could lead to complete system compromise. The most significant finding was an unpatched remote code execution vulnerability in the public-facing web server (CVE-2023-1234). Immediate remediation is recommended for all critical and high-risk findings.
```

## Technical Findings

### Vulnerability Report Format
1. **Title**: Clear, concise description
2. **Risk Rating**: Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info
3. **CVSS Score**: Base score and vector
4. **Affected Systems**: IPs, URLs, components
5. **Description**: Technical details
6. **Impact**: Potential consequences
7. **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce
8. **Remediation**: Specific actions to fix
9. **References**: CVEs, advisories, links

### Example Finding
```markdown
## SQL Injection in Login Form
- **Risk**: Critical (CVSS: 9.8)
- **Affected**: https://example.com/login
- **Description**: The login form is vulnerable to SQL injection...
- **Impact**: Full database compromise possible...
- **Proof**: 
  ```
  POST /login HTTP/1.1
  username=admin'--&password=anything
  ```
- **Remediation**: Use parameterized queries...
- **References**: OWASP A03:2021-Injection
```

## Risk Ratings

### Risk Rating Matrix
| Impact \ Likelihood | Very High | High | Medium | Low |
|----------------------|-----------|------|--------|-----|
| **Critical**         | Critical  | Critical | High | Medium |
| **High**            | Critical  | High    | Medium | Low |
| **Medium**          | High      | Medium  | Low    | Low |
| **Low**             | Medium    | Low     | Low    | Info |

### CVSS Scoring
- **0.1-3.9**: Low
- **4.0-6.9**: Medium
- **7.0-8.9**: High
- **9.0-10.0**: Critical

## Remediation Recommendations

### Effective Recommendations
- **Specific**: Include exact commands or code snippets
- **Actionable**: Clear, step-by-step instructions
- **Prioritized**: By risk level and effort
- **Verifiable**: Include validation steps

### Example Recommendation
```
1. Update Apache Tomcat to version 9.0.75 or later:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install --only-upgrade tomcat9
   ```
2. Restart the Tomcat service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart tomcat9
   ```
3. Verify the update:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:8080 | grep Server
   # Should show Tomcat/9.0.75 or later
   ```
```

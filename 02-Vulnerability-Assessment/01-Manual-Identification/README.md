# Manual Vulnerability Identification

Manual vulnerability identification involves systematically examining systems and applications for security weaknesses without relying solely on automated tools. This approach helps identify complex issues that automated scanners might miss.

## Version-Based Analysis

Identify and research software versions for known vulnerabilities:
- Web server software (Apache, Nginx, IIS)
- Application frameworks (Django, Ruby on Rails, .NET)
- Database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Operating system components

### Commands
```bash
# Check web server version
curl -I http://example.com

# Check database version
mysql --version
psql --version

# Search for known vulnerabilities
searchsploit "Apache 2.4.29"
```

## Common Misconfigurations

### File Permissions
- World-writable files and directories
- Insecure file ownership
- SUID/SGID misconfigurations

### Service Configurations
- Unnecessary services running
- Default configurations
- Insecure service settings

### Network Configurations
- Open ports and services
- Unencrypted protocols
- Unauthenticated access

## Default Credentials

Check for default or weak credentials:
- Application admin interfaces
- Database systems
- Network devices
- IoT devices

### Common Default Credentials
- admin/admin
- admin/password
- root/root
- guest/guest
- [Default Credentials Database](https://cirt.net/passwords)

## Manual Testing Techniques

### Input Validation Testing
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Command Injection
- File Inclusion

### Authentication Testing
- Brute force attacks
- Session management
- Password policies
- Multi-factor authentication bypass

### Business Logic Testing
- Workflow bypasses
- Price manipulation
- Access control issues

## üõ† Tools & Commands

| Tool | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Searchsploit | Exploit database search | `searchsploit apache 2.4.29` |
| Nmap | Service version detection | `nmap -sV -p- 192.168.1.100` |
| Burp Suite | Web application testing | GUI-based |
| OWASP ZAP | Web application testing | GUI-based |

## üìù Best Practices

1. Document all findings with proof of concept
2. Verify vulnerabilities manually when possible
3. Understand the impact of each vulnerability
4. Test in a controlled environment first
5. Be mindful of system stability during testing
6. Keep detailed notes of testing methodology

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Be aware of and comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Document your authorization and scope
- Be prepared to provide evidence of authorization if questioned

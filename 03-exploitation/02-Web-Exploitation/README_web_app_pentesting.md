# Web Application Penetration Testing

Welcome to the Web Application Penetration Testing section of the OSCP study guide. This section covers the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities in web applications, which are a common attack vector in modern networks.

## üìù Best Practices

- Always get proper authorization before testing
- Document all findings with proof of concept
- Test for impact, not just vulnerability presence
- Be aware of potential data exposure risks
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## üìÖ Study Plan

1. Set up a local testing environment
2. Learn about common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
3. Practice on vulnerable applications (DVWA, WebGoat, etc.)
4. Learn to use web proxies effectively
5. Practice manual exploitation before using automated tools

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Only test applications you own or have permission to test
- Be aware of data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Avoid causing damage or disruption to services
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly

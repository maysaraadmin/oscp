# Exploitation

This directory contains notes and techniques for the exploitation phase of penetration testing, focusing on gaining initial access to target systems.

## Contents

- [Exploit Development](exploit_development.md) - Techniques for developing and modifying exploits
- [Manual Exploitation](manual_exploitation.md) - Methods for manual exploitation without automated tools
- [Metasploit Cheatsheet](metasploit_cheatsheet.md) - Quick reference for Metasploit Framework commands
- [Privilege Escalation](privilege_escalation/) - Techniques for escalating privileges on compromised systems

## Key Concepts

- **Exploit Development**: Creating or modifying code to take advantage of software vulnerabilities
- **Manual Exploitation**: Using manual techniques to exploit vulnerabilities without automated tools
- **Metasploit Framework**: A powerful exploitation framework
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level permissions on a compromised system

## Tools

- `Metasploit Framework`
- `searchsploit`
- `Python` (for custom exploit development)
- `Immunity Debugger` / `WinDbg` (for Windows exploitation)
- `GDB` (for Linux exploitation)

## Best Practices

- Always test exploits in a controlled environment first
- Understand the exploit before running it
- Have a rollback plan in case something goes wrong
- Document all exploitation attempts and their results
- Be aware of the potential impact on the target system

# Post-Exploitation

This directory contains notes and techniques for the post-exploitation phase of penetration testing, focusing on maintaining access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement after initial compromise.

## Contents

- [Windows Privilege Escalation](windows_privilege_escalation.md) - Techniques for escalating privileges on Windows systems

## Key Concepts

- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level permissions on a compromised system
- **Persistence**: Maintaining access to a compromised system
- **Lateral Movement**: Moving between systems in a network
- **Credential Dumping**: Extracting credentials from a compromised system
- **Covering Tracks**: Removing evidence of compromise

## Tools

- `Mimikatz` (Windows credential dumping)
- `PowerSploit` (PowerShell post-exploitation framework)
- `BloodHound` (Active Directory analysis)
- `Impacket` (Network protocol attacks)
- `LinPEAS`/`WinPEAS` (Privilege escalation scripts)

## Best Practices

- Always have a clear objective for post-exploitation activities
- Document all actions and findings
- Be aware of the impact on the target system
- Use the principle of least privilege when possible
- Clean up after yourself when the engagement is complete
